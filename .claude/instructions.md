# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Animation Guidelines

When working with Framer Motion animations in this project:

1. **ALWAYS** reference the animation patterns documented in `docs/ai-guidelines/framer-motion-patterns.md`
2. **ALWAYS** follow the SOLID principles outlined in the patterns document
3. **ALWAYS** use TypeScript with proper typing
4. **ALWAYS** write code in English with comments in Spanish on the line before

## Code Standards

- Use `memo` for all animated components
- Define variants outside components or as constants
- Follow the performance optimization guidelines
- Use the color palette from tailwind.config.js

## Before Creating Animations

Read and apply patterns from: `docs/ai-guidelines/framer-motion-patterns.md`
